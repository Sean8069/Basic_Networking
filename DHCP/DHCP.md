 ## Why we need DHCP? <a name="intro"></a>
 Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol aka DHCP is probably one of the most commonly used services in the TCP/IP network. At its core, DHCP is a protocol that assigned ip addresses automatically to the clients. Before diving any deeper into DHCP, I always like to ask myself why, why is DHCP needed in the first place, what would happen if we do not have DHCP. Well, let's say you are a network administrator at Company A, your boss Derek wanted you to assign ip addresses of 5 client computers for the new employees, so you did what he said and statically assigned the ip addresses and subnet masks of each computer respectively. Next year, Company A grows bigger and Derek has the capital to hire more employees, so he did. He hired 100 employees, and you as the network administrator is asked again to now configure the ip addresses of the 100 client computers. See the problem now?
